                            <h2>Wadi Rum</h2>
                            <p>The 74,000-hectare property, inscribed as a mixed natural and cultural site, is situated
                                in southern Jordan, near the
                                border with Saudi Arabia. It features a varied desert landscape consisting of a range of
                                narrow gorges, natural arches,
                                towering cliffs, ramps, massive landslides and caverns. Petroglyphs, inscriptions and
                                archaeological remains in the site
                                testify to 12,000 years of human occupation and interaction with the natural
                                environment. The combination of 25,000 rock
                                carvings with 20,000 inscriptions trace the evolution of human thought and the early
                                development of the alphabet. The
                                site illustrates the evolution of pastoral, agricultural and urban activity in the
                                region.</p>
                            <h2>Outstanding Universal Value</h2>
                            <h3>Brief synthesis</h3>
                            <p>Wadi Rum Protected Area (WRPA) is located in the southern part of Jordan, east of the
                                Rift Valley and south of the steep
                                escarpment of the central Jordanian plateau. It comprises an area of 74,200 hectares.
                                WRPA’s natural values include
                                desert landforms developed within continental sandstones. These landforms have been
                                developed under the influence of a
                                combination of various controlling factors, such as lithology, tectonic activities
                                (including rapid uplift, numerous
                                faults and joints) and surface processes (including various types of weathering and
                                erosion associated with desert
                                climate as well as humid climates in the past), representing million years of ongoing
                                landscape evolution.</p>
                            <p>Widespread petroglyphs, inscriptions and archaeological remains testify to 12,000 years
                                of human occupation and
                                interaction with the natural environment, illustrating the evolution of pastoral,
                                agricultural and urban human activity
                                in the Arabian Peninsula and the environmental history of the region.</p>
                            <p><strong>Criterion (iii)</strong>: The rock art, inscriptions and archaeological evidence
                                in WRPA can be considered an exceptional
                                testimony of the cultural traditions of its early inhabitants. The combination of 25,000
                                petroglyphs, 20,000
                                inscriptions, and 154 archaeological sites provides evidence to continuity of habitation
                                and land-use over a period of
                                at least 12,000 years. The petroglyphs, representing human and animal figures, are
                                engraved on boulders, stones, and
                                cliff faces. They provide evidence of long-term patterns of pastoral, agricultural and
                                urban human activity in the
                                property. Engravings indicate an elaborate sense of aesthetics in a pictorial culture,
                                and the archaeological findings
                                span all eras from the Neolithic to the Nabataean. Thamudic, Nabataean and numerous
                                Arabic inscriptions in four
                                different scripts testify to the widespread literacy among its pastoral societies.</p>
                            <p><strong>Criterion (v)</strong>: The variety of landforms at WRPA has played an essential
                                role in fostering human settlement. The rock
                                art, inscriptions and water catchment systems document the settlements of successive
                                communities, which developed in
                                areas of mobile animal husbandry and agriculture and form part of a wider context of
                                human interaction with the
                                semi-arid eastern desert environment of the Arabian Peninsula. WRPA assists the
                                understanding of the continuum of
                                settled and mobile lifestyles in a desert landscape illustrating the adaptability and
                                ingenuity of human communities who
                                have made the most of scarce resources to sustain continuous presence after the climate
                                became dryer in the Bronze Age
                                (3rd millennium BC).</p>
                            <p><strong>Criterion (vii)</strong>: WRPA is recognised globally as an iconic desert
                                landscape, renowned for its spectacular series of
                                sandstone mountains and valleys, natural arches, and the range of narrow gorges,
                                towering cliffs, massive landslides,
                                and dramatic cavernous weathering forms displayed. Key attributes of the aesthetic
                                values of the property include the
                                diversity and sheer size of its landforms, together with the mosaic of colours, vistas
                                into both narrow canyons and very
                                large wadis, and the scale of the cliffs. The property displays, in a protected setting,
                                an exceptional combination of
                                landforms resulting from drainage incision, severe weathering by salt, biological and
                                other processes, and the
                                undermining of steep sandstone cliffs by these weathering processes, together with the
                                world’s most spectacular networks
                                of honeycomb weathering features. Its associations with the writings of T.E. Lawrence,
                                stressed strongly in the
                                nomination, have ensured a high profile for the property and have reinforced its
                                reputation of the area as a classic
                                desert landscape both globally and within the Arab States.</p>

                            </div>
                            <h3>Integrity</h3>
                            <p>Since the identification of Wadi Rum as a potential nature reserve in 1978 the various
                                landforms and cultural resources
                                have been managed in a shared framework, which prevented extensive development impacts
                                and maintained the landscape
                                character of the property. The buffer zone of Rum Village contains significant cultural
                                property values and the cultural
                                landscape character of the property reaches even beyond the mostly 5 kilometers
                                perimeter of the buffer zone.</p>
                            <h3>Authenticity</h3>
                            <p>The rock art remains in its original setting, largely unaltered except for the effects of
                                weathering, which has led to
                                its fading as result of rain and wind erosion, leaving some petroglyphs hard to
                                distinguish. In addition modern graffiti
                                has a negative impact on several of the original drawings and inscriptions. However, the
                                fact that so many petroglyphs
                                and inscriptions have been documented means that their ability to convey the cultural
                                traditions of the people who made
                                them continues and that they qualify as an important resource for research.</p>

                                <p><em>WRPA was established in 1997 following cabinet decision no. 27/11/3226 (1997) and
                                        extended in 2002, following decision
                                        224/11/1/986 (2002). It is further recognized as an archaeological site under
                                        the Law of the Department of Antiquities
                                        no. 21 (1988) and constitutes a Special Regulation Area under the Administration
                                        of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone. In
                                        addition to the existing protection for the property, special consideration may
                                        need to be given to archaeological
                                        artefacts to prevent their removal from the property.</em></p>
                                <p><em>The primary plan guiding the management and development program of WRPA is the
                                        Aqaba Special Economic Zone land use
                                        plan, which covers the whole governorate of Aqaba and is administrated by the
                                        Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority. The
                                        property has an up to date management plan and an effective management unit,
                                        including rangers and other staff is
                                        dedicated to the management of the property. The management plan should provide
                                        emphasis to the management of the
                                        natural and cultural values of the property. A comprehensive survey and
                                        inventory of the natural and cultural resources,
                                        conservation and interpretation programme of the values of the property, and
                                        cooperation with antiquity authorities as
                                        management partners are all required. The WRPA requires continuous monitoring,
                                        preventive conservation of natural and
                                        cultural resources, and periodic updating of the management plan.</em></p>
                                <p><em>A number of threats that have been identified require careful attention. In this
                                        context priority should be given to the

                                        infrastructure, but also the potential encroachment of
