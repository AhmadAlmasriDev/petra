                            <p>Did you know that Petra is called the lost city? The famous <srong>archaeological site in
                                    Jordan
                                </srong> was
                                once a
                                rich trading city,
                                but after its decline it was completely abandoned and fell into oblivion, making it a
                                <srong>
                                    lost city</srong>.
                            </p>

                            <p>In the 7th century AD. Petra was a thriving city dedicated to economic exchanges
                                inhabited
                                first
                                by
                                the <strong>Edomites</strong> and
                                then by the <srong>Nabatai</srong> who subsequently abandoned it permanently following
                                the
                                decline of trade in
                                the
                                area and various
                                natural disasters.</p>
                            <p>After several centuries in which the city of Petra remained abandoned and hidden in the
                                arid
                                plateau
                                of Jordan, it was
                                rediscovered in 1812 thanks to <strong>Johann Ludwig Burckhardt</strong>, a well-known
                                Swiss
                                explorer not new to

                                exploits.</p>

                            <p>Burckhardt in fact, during his short but intense life, explored much of the Middle East,
                                making
                                the

                                discover numerous testimonies of the past in countries such as Syria, Egypt and
                                obviously
                                Jordan.</p>

                            <h3>History and curiosities about Petra</h3>
                            <p>the moment of its discovery, Petra has become so famous that it has recently earned the
                                title
                                of among the <strong>7
                                    Wonders of the Modern</strong> World and is considered an <strong>UNESCO World
                                    Heritage
                                    Site</strong>!</p>

                            <p>The timeless charm of the lost city has captured the attention of several directors who
                                have
                                wanted
                                Petra as a film set
                                for some films including the very famous <strong>Indiana Jones and the last
                                    crusade</strong>
                                directed by <strong>Steven
                                    Spielberg</strong>.</p>


                            <p>Petra was a real city which, at the peak of its size, had about 25,000 inhabitants in an
                                area
                                of
                                264,000 square
                                meters. Houses, tombs and monuments were entirely carved out from the particularly
                                resistant
                                and
                                easily excavated local
                                sandstone rock.</p>

                            <p>The particular geological conformation that characterizes Petra combined with the
                                outstanding
                                engineering skills of its
                                inhabitants, have made their buildings very long-lived and is the reason why we can
                                still
                                admire
                                hundreds of tombs and
                                monuments almost intact today despite the natural events that hit the area.</p>

                            <h3>The Treasury of Petra and the Monastery</h3>
                            <p>The most famous tomb but also the best preserved is <strong>"the Treasury"</strong> of
                                Petra,
                                an
                                imposing facade
                                about 40 meters high and
                                carved into the rock located right at the entrance of the city as if to welcome the
                                thousands of
                                tourists who flock to
                                <strong>the most important archaeological site in Jordan</strong> every year.
                            </p>


                            <p>To reach this magnificent attraction it is necessary to take the <strong>Siq</strong>, a
                                sandy
                                path of about 1.5
                                km
                                through a narrow
                                canyon. The Treasury can be seen a few tens of meters before the end of the Siq until it
                                is
                                fully
                                revealed in all its
                                beauty.</p>
                            <div class="base-image-container article-image-size">
                                <img src="assets/image/article-03-image-big-01.jpg" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <p>Although the Treasury is the best preserved and best known monument in Petra, the largest
                                is
                                the
                                <strong>Monastery</strong>, an imposing
                                structure carved into the rock that satisfies any visitor who is able to tackle the
                                hundreds
                                of
                                steps to climb necessary
                                to reach it.
                            </p>

                            <p>Among the many constructions carved into the rock, in addition to tombs and houses, there
                                are
                                several places dedicated
                                to free time such as the Roman theater that could hold up to 3000 people, temples and
                                even
                                spas
                                to
                                relax.</p>

                            <h3>Petra by night</h3>
                            <p>One of the must-do experiences if you visit the lost city is to see <strong>Petra at
                                    night</strong> and more
                                precisely to admire the
                                magnificent spectacle that takes place at the foot of the Treasury on some days of the
                                week.
                            </p>

                            <p>To admire <strong>Petra by night</strong> you walk along the Siq illuminated by numerous
                                candles
                                that lead up to
                                its
                                majesty "the
                                Treasury" also illuminated by hundreds of candles that make the magical and mysterious
                                atmosphere.</p>

                            <p>Sitting in respectful silence in front of him, we await the start of the show in which a
                                particular
                                music accompanies a
                                voice that tells the glorious past of Petra which, from a rich and prosperous city,
                                touches
                                the
                                bottom until it is
                                forgotten and then flourishes again and becomes one of the 7 wonders of the world!</p>

                            <h2>My impression about Petra:</h2>

                            <div class="highlight-text">
                                <p><em>Needless to say how exciting it is to admire one of the 7 wonders of the world,
                                        but
                                        what
                                        struck
                                        me most about Petra is
                                        that you have to earn the thrill by crossing the Siq that leads to the
                                        Treasury.</em>
                                </p>

                                <p><em>A long walk just enough to be faced by everyone and to grow that feeling that

                                        wait and which is rewarded
                                        with the amazement of seeing the Treasure in all its beauty reveal itself after
                                        a
