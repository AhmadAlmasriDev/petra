                        <h2>Wadi Musa</h2>
                        <p>translated to the Valley of Moses is a town that is set within a valley that surrounds the

                            a large number of hotels and plenty of local restaurants to match, in recent years
                            <strong>Wadi Musa</strong> has seen a tourism boom
                            with visitors choosing to use the town as a base to explore <strong>Petra</strong>. Do not
                            let the idea of tourists put you off of
                            staying in <strong>Wadi Musa</strong> because the town now depends on this tourism to
                            survive. It is a fairly compact town with a unique
                            Jordanian charm. It has everything required for a holiday with many authentic places to eat
                            and stay. After a long day
                            of hiking through Petra, visitors will be pleased to know that there are plenty of places to
                            relax in Wadi Musa

                        <h3>Location of Wadi Musa</h3>
                        <p>Wadi Musa is located in <strong>southern Jordan</strong> and meets with the Kingâ€™s Highway.
                            It is 4 kilometers in length and leads to the
                            entrance of Petra which is a ten-minute walk from many hotels. The journey between
                            <strong>Wadi Musa</strong> and the capital city of
                            <strong>Amman</strong> takes just under three hours by car. From the city of
                            <strong>Madaba</strong> visitors can also reach Wadi Musa in around 2 hours
                            and 50 minutes via the Desert Highway.
                        </p>


                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>In Arabic, <strong>Wadi Musa</strong> translates to the Valley of Moses. It is named this
                            because it is believed that Moses walked
                            through the valley with his followers. When entering Petra via The Siq, visitors will also
                            notice the channels that were
                            built by the Nabateans to connect the city to the water from <strong>Wadi Musa</strong>.
