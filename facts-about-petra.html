                            <p>Here are some exciting facts about <strong>Petra</strong>.</p>
                            <h3>When was Petra established</h3>
                            <p>Petra is believed have been established in 312 BC, making it one of the oldest cities in
                                the world. It was the capital
                                city of Nabateans, who were ancient southern Arab people that arrived in Jordan around
                                the 6th century BC. They were
                                essentially the makers of one of the most extraordinary prehistoric civilisations.</p>
                            <h3>New Seven Wonders</h3>
                            <p>Along with the Great Wall of China, Peru’s Machu Picchu, India’s Taj Mahal, the Roman
                                Colosseum in Italy, Mexico’s
                                Chichen Itza and Brazil’s Christ the Redeemer, Petra was named one the New Seven Wonders
                                of the World in 2007.</p>
                            <h3>Exploration of Petra</h3>
                            <p>Approximately only 15% of Petra has been explored by archaeologists, which therefore
                                means that there is still plenty to
                                be revealed.</p>
                            <h3>How to get there</h3>
                            <p>To enter Petra, you need to go through a narrow gorge called the Siq, which is around 1km
                                long. It is bound by cliffs
                                each side which are around 8 metres high.</p>

                            <h3>Who discovered Petra</h3>
                            <p>A Swiss explorer called Johann Ludwig Burckhardt discovered Petra in 1812. Because it was
                                an unknown metropolitan for
                                around 5 centuries, it is also called the ‘Lost City’.</p>
                            <h3>UNESCO World Heritage site</h3>
                            <p>Petra Archaeological Park became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985 due to its
                                historical important and delicate
                                structure. Furthermore, Petra is half-built, half-carved into rock.</p>
                            <h3>Water System</h3>
                            <p>It wouldn’t have been possible for Petra to exist if it had not been for the water
                                channel system that was constructed
                                to offer storage and supply for its people. As a result, there was apparently enough
                                water to support the 30,000
                                citizens that are believed to have occupied Petra.</p>
