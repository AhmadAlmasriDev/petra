                    <p>Did you know that Petra is called the lost city? The famous <srong>archaeological site in Jordan
                        </srong> was
                        once a
                        rich trading city,
                        but after its decline it was completely abandoned and fell into oblivion, making it a <srong>
                            lost city</srong>.

                    <p>In the 7th century AD. Petra was a thriving city dedicated to economic exchanges inhabited first
                        by
                        the <strong>Edomites</strong> and
                        then by the Nabatai who subsequently abandoned it permanently following the decline of trade in
                        the
                        area and various
                        natural disasters.</p>
                    After several centuries in which the city of Petra remained abandoned and hidden in the arid
                    plateau
                    of Jordan, it was
                    rediscovered in 1812 thanks to Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, a well-known Swiss explorer not new to
                    such
                    exploits.

                    Burckhardt in fact, during his short but intense life, explored much of the Middle East, making
                    the
                    Western world
                    discover numerous testimonies of the past in countries such as Syria, Egypt and obviously
                    Jordan.

                    History and curiosities about Petra
                    From the moment of its discovery, Petra has become so famous that it has recently earned the
                    title
                    of among the 7
                    Wonders of the Modern World and is considered an UNESCO World Heritage Site!

                    The timeless charm of the lost city has captured the attention of several directors who have
                    wanted
                    Petra as a film set
                    for some films including the very famous Indiana Jones and the last crusade directed by Steven
                    Spielberg.


                    Petra was a real city which, at the peak of its size, had about 25,000 inhabitants in an area of
                    ​​264,000 square
                    meters. Houses, tombs and monuments were entirely carved out from the particularly resistant and
                    easily excavated local
                    sandstone rock.

                    The particular geological conformation that characterizes Petra combined with the outstanding
                    engineering skills of its
                    inhabitants, have made their buildings very long-lived and is the reason why we can still admire
                    hundreds of tombs and
                    monuments almost intact today despite the natural events that hit the area.


                    The Treasury of Petra and the Monastery
                    The most famous tomb but also the best preserved is "the Treasury" of Petra, an imposing facade
                    about 40 meters high and
                    carved into the rock located right at the entrance of the city as if to welcome the thousands of
                    tourists who flock to
                    the most important archaeological site in Jordan every year.

                    To reach this magnificent attraction it is necessary to take the Siq, a sandy path of about 1.5
                    km
                    through a narrow
                    canyon. The Treasury can be seen a few tens of meters before the end of the Siq until it is
                    fully
                    revealed in all its
                    beauty.

                    Although the Treasury is the best preserved and best known monument in Petra, the largest is the
                    Monastery, an imposing
                    structure carved into the rock that satisfies any visitor who is able to tackle the hundreds of
                    steps to climb necessary
                    to reach it.

                    Among the many constructions carved into the rock, in addition to tombs and houses, there are
                    several places dedicated
                    to free time such as the Roman theater that could hold up to 3000 people, temples and even spas
                    to
                    relax.

                    Petra by night
                    One of the must-do experiences if you visit the lost city is to see Petra at night and more
                    precisely to admire the
                    magnificent spectacle that takes place at the foot of the Treasury on some days of the week.

                    To admire Petra by night you walk along the Siq illuminated by numerous candles that lead up to
                    its
                    majesty "the
                    Treasury" also illuminated by hundreds of candles that make the magical and mysterious
                    atmosphere.

                    Sitting in respectful silence in front of him, we await the start of the show in which a
                    particular
                    music accompanies a
                    voice that tells the glorious past of Petra which, from a rich and prosperous city, touches the
                    bottom until it is
                    forgotten and then flourishes again and becomes one of the 7 wonders of the world!
